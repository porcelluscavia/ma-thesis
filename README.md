To re-run the experiments I carried out in my thesis, run the following files:
```
dialects_predict.sh
# When the previous script has finished running, run:
dialects_analyze.sh

tweets_predict.sh
# When the previous script has finished running, run:
tweets_analyze.sh

tweets_predict_attention.sh
# When the previous script has finished running, run:
tweets_analyze_attention.sh
```

The exact state of the codebase as used in my MA thesis is available via the [`ma-thesis` release](https://github.com/verenablaschke/ma-thesis/releases/tag/ma-thesis).

The tables with the results are in the [models](https://github.com/verenablaschke/ma-thesis/tree/main/models) directory.
